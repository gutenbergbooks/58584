INDEX

    A.
    Accumulation, a circumstance of no account in Political Economy, page 169, note.
    Air, Atmospheric, has utility without having value, 137;
        but if pumped into a diving-bell, the service has value, 138.
    Algeria, usual rate of interest in, said to be 10 per cent., 302.
    Aphorisms, the Two, "Each for all, all for each"-"Each for himself, each by himself," 339-346.
        Opposed to each other if we regard the motive, not so if we look to results, 339.
        No incompatibility in this last view between individualism and association, 340.
        Men associate in obedience to self-interest, ib.
        Difficulties attending a state of isolation lead naturally to association, 341.
        As regards labour and exchanges, the principle "Each for himself" must be predominant, 342.
        By following the rule each for himself, individual efforts act in the direction of each for all, 343.
        Icarian expedition proceeded on the principle of all for each, 344, note.
        Principles of Socialism and Communism refuted, 343, 344.
        All desire monopolies and privileges, even the working classes, at their own expense, 345, 346.
    B.
    Barter, primitive form of exchange, direct or roundabout, 108.
        When barter is effected by means of an intermediate commodity, it is called sale and purchase, 109.
        Barter of two factors, 110.
        Value resolves itself into a barter of services, 137.

        Letter to, quoted, 14.
    Candlemakers' Petition quoted, 19.
    Capital et Rente, pamphlet by Bastiat against the Socialists, 22.
    Capital, in the beginning formed very slowly, 197.
        Consists of tools, materials, and provisions, 198.
        The man who furnishes capital renders a service, and is paid for that service, 199, 200.
        The man who accords delay renders a service, and hence the legitimacy of interest, 203, 204.
        Principle which governs the returns for capital, 206-211.
        Progress of mankind coincides with rapid accumulation of capital, 210.
        Capital has in itself a power of progression, 211.
        Increase of capital is followed by increase of general prosperity, 212.
        By increase of capital, the capitalist's absolute share of product increased, his relative share diminished, while labourer's share is increased both absolutely and relatively, ib.
        Illustrations of this, 213-216.
        Progress of civilisation tends to lower rate of interest, 302.
        Rates in Brazil, Algeria, Spain, Italy, Germany, France, England, and Holland, ib.
        Relations of capitalist and labourer, 383.

        Falsest theories abroad, ib.
        Due to M. de Sismondi and M. Buret, ib.
        Labourer's share of product has a tendency to increase as capital increases, 385.
        When exchange takes place between capital, or anterior labour, and present labour, it is not on the footing of their duration or intensity, but of their value, 387.
        Anterior labour has a general tendency to become depreciated, 388, 389.
        Presence of capital always beneficial to labourer, 390.
        Groundless outcry against tyranny of capital, 391, 392.

        His efforts for the suppression of war, 375.
    Communists, their erroneous views of landed property controverted, 155.
    Competition, no organization or form of association can be substituted for, 288.
        Implies freedom from all constraint, 289.
        Levels all factitious inequalities, 290.
        Misunderstood by the Socialists, ib.
        Value diminishes through the co-operation of natural forces, not of its own accord, but by the pressure exerted by competition, 291, 292.
        In the absence of competition, society would be constituted on the principle of universal monopoly, ib.
        Competition enables one country to participate in the natural advantages of another, 293.
        Examples of this, 294, 299.
        Inventions and discoveries become, through competition, the common and gratuitous patrimony of all, 299.
        Mode in which this takes place, 300, 301.
        Competition among capitalists reduces the price of commodities, 301, 302.
        Progress of civilisation tends to lower the rate of interest, and this effected by competition, 302.
        If wages are sometimes reduced by competition, the labourers, as consumers, profit by it, 303-307.
        Competition tends to render services proportional to efforts, 306.
        Laws of modern society too often cramp competition, 309, 310.
        Competition essential to progress, and allied with human perfectibility, 313.
        It approximates ranks, fortunes, and intelligence, 316.
        Advantages from inventions, or from local situation, climate, etc., slip rapidly from hands of producers, and go to enlarge enjoyments of consumers, 333, 334.
        Same thing holds of disadvantages, 334.
    Condillac quoted, 114, 107.
    Considérant, M., his work on Socialism quoted, 62, note.
        His opinions on landed property, 257-260.
    Consumer, every man may in turn be both producer and consumer, 324, 325.
        The wishes and desires of consumers are those which are in harmony with the public interest, 325.
        Consumers and producers should be left free to take care of their own interests, 326.
        The effect of inventions and discoveries on the interests of consumers and producers represented by diagrams, 331, 332.
        Advantages from inventions, or from local situation, climate, etc., slip rapidly from the hands of producers, and go to enlarge the enjoyments of consumers, 333, 334.
        Same thing holds of disadvantages, 334.
        All great economic effects must be regarded from the consumer's point of view, ib.
        Subordination of producer's interests to those of consumer confirmed when viewed in connexion with morals, 335.
        Consumer is alone responsible for morality or utility of production, 338.
        Producer looks only to value, ib.
        Consumer represents society, ib.
    Consumption, a term employed to designate the enjoyment to which utility gives rise, 323.
        General prosperity is measured by consumption, and not by labour, 325.

    Malthus on population, referred to, 113.
        Vindicated from violent attacks made on him, 397.
        Authors of those attacks writers of no reputation and grossly ignorant, ib.
        Malthus feared that, with so great a power of reproduction, mankind would come to exceed what the earth could maintain but for prudence and foresight, 398.
        An expression which occurred in the first edition of his Essay on Population, to the effect that population increases in a geometrical, and food in an arithmetical progression, gave rise to misrepresentation, ib.
        Made a handle of by Godwin and Sismondi, and was suppressed in all subsequent editions, 399.
        Attacks continued notwithstanding, the fiercest proceeding from men who confessed they had not read Malthus's work, ib.
        The laws of population cannot be comprised in a brief aphorism or formula, 400.
        Were known before Malthus wrote, 402.
        Objections to his theory illogical, 405.

        Wrong in adopting the limit of twenty-five years, although that holds good in America, 406, 407.
        Malthus attributes more force to repressive than preventive check, 410.
        His true formula is, not that population tends to keep on a level with, but to go beyond, the means of subsistence, 416.

    Population, laws of, cannot be comprised in a brief formula, 400.
        Vindication of Malthus, and of the general doctrine of his Essay on Population, 397, 400.
        If, as wealth increases, the number among whom it is to be divided increases more rapidly, absolute wealth may be greater, but individual wealth will be less, 401.
        Malthus has reduced the principle to the formula that population tends to keep on a level with the means of subsistence, 402.
        This principle not new; every writer on such subjects since Aristotle has proclaimed it, ib.
        Enunciated by Sir James Steuart thirty years before the appearance of the Essay on Population, ib., note.
        Nature has taken greater care of species than of individuals, in order to insure the perpetuity of races, 402.
        Instances of this in the vegetable kingdom, ib.;
            and in animals whose life is of a type more akin to vegetables, 402, 403.
        Advancing in scale of social life, means of reproduction bestowed with greater parsimony, ib.
        In the human species, reproductive faculty less powerful than in any other, ib.
        But, physically, man does not escape the law of a tendency to multiplication beyond the limits of space and nourishment, ib.
        Difference between the physiological power of multiplying and actual multiplication, ib.
        Malthus inquired in what period of time mankind would double, if space and food were unlimited, 404.
        But as this hypothesis is never realized, theoretical must be shorter than actual period, ib.
        Different rates of increase in different countries according to estimate of M. Moreau de Jonnès, 403.
        Such differences not the result of physiological causes, but of external obstacles, 404.
        New sources of local wealth lead invariably to increase of population, ib.
        Objections made to the theory of Malthus very illogical, ib.
        Nor are the arguments against his geometrical progression more conclusive, ib.
        Fixed on twenty-five years as the minimum period in which population may double itself, because this actually takes place in America, 405.
        Malthus merely asserts that it has a tendency to increase in a geometrical progression, ib.
        That this virtual power of multiplication will be restrained is just what Malthus contends for, ib.
        Restrained by preventive and repressive checks, 406.
        He was wrong in adopting the limit of twenty-five years, although it holds good in America, 406, 407.
        This mixing up of the virtual and the real has exposed him to be misunderstood and misrepresented, 406.
        Calculation by Euler of period of doubling, 407.

        Vegetable life limited by want of space and territorial fertility-animals destitute of foresight, by want of food, 409.

        Law of limitation as regards man manifests itself by the double action of foresight and destruction, 410.
        The term moral restraint, used by Malthus, does not give us a just idea of the domain of foresight, ib.
        Other obstacles besides fear of poverty aid the action of the law of limitation in its preventive shape, 410, 411.
        Marriages on an average are probably later than they otherwise would be by eight years in consequence of these preventive obstacles, 411.
        Supposed advice of an old clergyman regarding too early marriages, 411, 412.
        Man's perfectibility an important element in resolving the problem of population, 413.
        Malthus, by neglecting this, has attributed less force to the preventive than to the repressive check, ib.
        For the expression, "means of subsistence," Say has substituted one more exact, namely, "means of existence," ib.
        Man's constant effort to better his condition exercises control over increase of numbers, 414.
        Better circumstances induce greater foresight, ib.
        In countries like China or Ireland, when rice and potatoes fail, there is nothing to fall back on, and repressive check comes into operation, 416.
        The true formula of Malthus is, not that population tends to keep on a level with, but to go beyond, the means of subsistence, ib.
        Foresight prevents this in the human race, ib.

        The effect of inventions and discoveries on the interest of producers and consumers illustrated by diagrams, 331, 332.
        Advantages, from inventions, or from local situation, climate, etc., slip rapidly from the hands of producers, and go to enlarge enjoyments of consumers, 333, 334.
        Same thing holds of disadvantages, 334.
        Producer has nothing to do with the utility of what is produced, only with its value, 336.
        The utility concerns the demander, ib.
        It is in the intention of the consumer that moral or immoral enjoyment is to be discovered, 338.
    Production is to modify and combine substances, not to create, them, 100.
        Production and consumption not the best terms to designate services rendered and received, 323.
        Production is employed to designate whatever confers utility, ib.

        Dr Johnson's opinion on this subject quoted, 473, note.
        Every action gives rise to consequences, of which some fall back on the agent, and others on his family or on society, hence responsibility and solidarity, 474.
        Responsibility applies to the person who acts, ib.
        We cannot even conceive of man as exempt from suffering, 474, 475.
        Our notions of sensibility and existence are inseparable, 475.
        Faith the necessary complement of our destinies, ib.
        Without sensibility we should be constantly exposed to death, ib.
        If, of the consequences following on action, the majority are bad and hurtful, such action tends to limit and restrain itself, 476.
        Ignorance gives rise to bad habits and bad laws, knowledge and experience to the reverse, ib.
        Mission of evil is to destroy its own cause and stimulate progress, 477.
        Responsibility has three sanctions,-natural, religious, and legal, 478.
        The first of these is fundamental, ib.
        Is an act vicious because revelation declares it so, or does revelation declare it so because its consequences are bad? ib.

        Difficulties on the subject of saving removed by reference to the principle of value, 391.
        To interpose delay between services rendered and received is itself to render a service; it has value, and hence the origin of interest, 395.

    Services, human transactions, when free, resolve themselves into exchange of, 43.
        Value consists in comparative appreciation of, 73.
        Service is effort in one man, while the want and satisfaction are in another, 74.
        Exchange of, forms the subject of Political Economy, 133.
        Effort saved to the person who receives a service imparts value to the service rendered, 140-142.
        Service a better term than Labour, 158.
        Every product which has value implies a service, but every service does not imply a product; value, therefore, is in service, 174.
        When value passes from service to product, it undergoes, in product, all the risks and chances to which the service itself is subject, 176.
        Service is rendered by the man who furnishes capital, 199, 200.

        Exclude competition, 435, 436.
        Question is, what services should remain in the domain of private exertion, what in that of public? 436.
        Government action is legitimate only where intervention of force legitimate, 437;
            and legitimate only in the case of defence of liberty and property, ib.;
            and to ensure the predominance of justice, 438, 439.
        When the State goes beyond this, it destroys liberty and property, which are placed under its safeguard, ib.
        Province of Government confined to what involves public security, taking care of common property, and levying contributions for public service, 440.

    Social Motive Force described and explained, 495-503.
        Personal interest is the social motive force which leads us to shun evil and seek after good, 495.
        Attraction towards happiness and repulsion from pain, the mainspring of the social mechanism, 496.
        This impulsive force is under direction of our intelligence, and intelligence may err, ib.
        The laws of responsibility and solidarity lend assistance to repress error and injustice, 497.
        Attempts of the Socialists to substitute devotion and self-sacrifice for personal interest, as the social motive force, combated, 498, 499.

    Solidarity is collective responsibility, 488.
        Not of legislative creation, as represented by Rousseau, 488, 489.
        The philosophers of the last century did not believe in it, 489.
        Instances in which individuals suffer from the errors or faults of others-this is the law of solidarity, 489, 490.
        Responsibility is not exclusively personal, but is shared and divided, 490.
        Society, in turn, suffers from the errors or faults of individuals, and the law of solidarity comes to check such actions, 491.
        Solidarity, like responsibility, is a progressive force, and resolves itself into repercussive or reflected responsibility, ib.
        To enable those who suffer from another's acts to react against them, connexion between cause and effect should be known, 492.
        Not always known, from the circumstance that the first effect may seem good, though all the subsequent consequences are bad, ib.
        Example of this in case of war, ib.
        In the case of slavery, of religious errors, and of prohibition, ib.
        Human law should coincide with the natural law, and organize reaction, 493.
        Example of this in case of violence, which provokes vengeance, law steps in to repress it with regularity and certainty, 493, 494.
        Economic view of the law of solidarity not indicated by the author in this chapter, 494, note.

    Utility, onerous and gratuitous, 69.
        By substituting gratuitous for onerous utility, progress annihilates value, ib.
        Gratuitous, tends to take the place of onerous utility, 90, 91.
        Mode in which this is effected, 91, 92.
        Attributing value to utility has led to many errors, 164-167.
        The term Production employed to designate whatever confers utility, and Consumption to designate the enjoyment to which that utility gives rise, 323.
        What renders service to the masses is utility alone, and value is not the measure of it, 325;
            but in the case of the individual, value is the measure of it, 325, 326.
        General utility and onerous utility represented by lines of unequal length; gratuitous utility, by indefinite lines, 328.
        Utility formerly onerous, now become gratuitous, also represented by lines, 330.
    V.
    Value consists in the comparative appreciation of reciprocal services, 73.
        Does not reside in material substances, as represented by Smith, 91.
        Vague definition of, 108.
        Value represents effort, 109.
        Theory of value, 131.
        As essential to Political Economy as numeration is to arithmetic, ib.
        Value has a tendency to diminish in relation to utility, 132.
        Does not extend to the co-operation of nature, but is restricted exclusively to human efforts, 134.
        A state of isolation excludes the idea of value, ib.
        Exchange imparts the notion of value, 135.
        Value is the relation of two services exchanged, ib.
        Not necessarily proportionate to intensity of efforts, 138.
        Arises in some cases, not from the effort of the person who renders the service, but from the effort saved to the person who receives it, 140, 141.
        This is a new principle not to be found in any other work on Political Economy, 141.
        Intervention of money does not change the principle, 142, 143.
        Value does not reside in commodities, but in services, 143.
        Examples of various kinds of services, all possessed of value, 147.
        Limits within which value oscillates, ib.;
            other examples, 148, 149.
        The precious metals not a perfect standard of value, as their own value fluctuates, 151, 152.
        Value not an attribute of matter, 153.
        This an error of the Physiocrates and of Adam Smith, and has given rise to the distinction between productive and unproductive labour, 153, 154.
        Value not a thing having independent existence, but a relation, 158.
        Value and Labour are not proportional, 159, 160, note.
        Measure of value the quadrature of Political Economy, 170.
        Fixity cannot be found in a mean term composed of variable elements, ib.
        Absolute measure of, a chimera, ib.
        Value being supposed to be in the material product, and not in the service, has led to Smith's error as to unproductive labour, 172.
        When value passes from service to product, it undergoes, in product, all the risks and chances to which the service itself is subject, 176.
        Prevailing tendency of value incorporated with a commodity is to fall, 178.
        Value is the measure of the utility of services rendered to the individual, not of those rendered to the masses, 325, 326.

        Remuneration by wages has the principle of fixity, so much sought after, 357.
        Opinions of the Socialists on this subject controverted, 357, 358.
        Wages, their origin, form, and effects, 358.
        Labour may be remunerated either by share of its product or by fixed wages, 359.
        Dependence not caused by form of remuneration, but by precarious situation of labourer, ib.
        No men worse off than fishermen and vine-dressers, though they have the benefits of association, 359, 360.
        Results of labour applied to the chase, fishing, or agriculture very uncertain, ib.
        To obviate this, a fixed unconditional bargain preferred, 360.
        This is not to destroy, but improve, the principle of association, ib.
        Risks appreciated by means of experimental statistics, ib.
        Remuneration by share of produce characteristic of times of barbarism, 361.
        Fixity of remuneration a step of progress, ib.
        Association not thereby dissolved, ib.
        Capital and labour both take a share of risk till it can be estimated by experience, ib.
        This state of things gives place to a bargain which ensure unity of direction and fixity of situation, 362.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
